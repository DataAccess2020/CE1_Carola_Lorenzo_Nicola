Research Question: "Are National Parliaments representative of the population in relation to the age?"

We decided to check if the average age of Parliament Members in three European Countries was in line with the median age of the population they represent.

We took our data from the "Global Parliamentary Report".

The project contains our R scripts, a graph folder with .png file of our plot, a data folder with the .xls file of the dataset, a report in .Rmd and this README file.
